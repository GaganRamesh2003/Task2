                <h3>Toll Tax Management System (DBMS Project)</h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Toll Tax Management System is a web-based application developed to automate the toll collection process, ensuring quick and efficient collection at toll booths. The system was designed to reduce human intervention, enhance accuracy, and cut down the time required for toll transactions.</p>
                <p><strong>Goals:</strong> The primary goal of this project was to replace the traditional manual toll collection system with a more efficient, automated solution. It aimed to eliminate delays caused by manual verification, reduce errors in toll collection, and ensure faster traffic flow.</p>
                <p><strong>Process & Features:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Integrated with a database to manage vehicle registrations, toll collections, and transaction records.</li>
                    <li>Enabled real-time toll payments via a web interface, eliminating the need for manual cash handling.</li>
                    <li>Developed a user-friendly dashboard for toll booth operators to monitor toll transactions and generate reports.</li>
                    <li>Implemented an automated vehicle identification system to speed up the process and reduce congestion.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, PHP, XAMPP Apache Server</p>

                <h3>Cyber-Physical Security of EMS for CAEVs (Major Project)</h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This project focused on assessing the cybersecurity of Electric and Autonomous Vehiclesâ€™ Energy Management Systems (EMS). The EMS is responsible for managing the energy distribution within electric and autonomous vehicles, and ensuring its security is crucial for the overall safety and efficiency of the vehicle.</p>
                <p><strong>Goals:</strong> The primary goal was to identify vulnerabilities in the EMS, assess the risks associated with these vulnerabilities, and propose solutions to mitigate potential cyber-attacks. The project aimed to enhance the resilience and security of the EMS against external threats that could compromise vehicle safety or energy efficiency.</p>
                <p><strong>Process & Features:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analyzed the EMS architecture of electric and autonomous vehicles to understand potential entry points for cyber-attacks.</li>
                    <li>Conducted penetration testing on various EMS components to identify weak points in the system.</li>
                    <li>Proposed countermeasures and strategies to mitigate identified risks and strengthen EMS security, including encryption, secure authentication methods, and intrusion detection systems.</li>
                    <li>Created a report detailing the findings and recommended solutions to improve the security of EMS.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, Penetration Testing Tools, Security Protocols, Risk Assessment Techniques</p>
